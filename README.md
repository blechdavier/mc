# Three.js Voxel World

Made this a couple summers ago and uploaded it to GitHub recently

## What is it?
This doesn't have very many features at all, and was pretty much an abandoned personal project I used to test GitHub Pages. It should be up at https://blechdavier.github.io/mc for anyone who's interested in giving it a go.

Making an interactive voxel world has always been a goal of mine, and I've made some other attempts, some of which are better.
You can see their clunky code from newest to oldest at:
- https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1219380 (has water)
- https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1136765 (has trees to some extent, they glitch on chunk borders)
- https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1136765 (generates with a bunch of ores and caves and stuff, but this is very unoptimized)
- https://openprocessing.org/sketch/997014 (not sure what I was doing here ðŸ˜†)
- https://openprocessing.org/sketch/995867 (actually kind of interesting; I was working on implementing a super quick greedy meshing algorithm)
